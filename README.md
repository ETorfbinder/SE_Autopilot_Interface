Space Engineers Interface Script between Spug's Easy Automated Docking and the Vanilla Autopilot


Hey there. These two scrips are a pitiful attempt to connect the vanilla autopilot with the automated docking script by Spug.
I never wrote a script before and also this is my first time using C#. I have no clue what I'm doing but 
in the end I got those two scripts working.
If you have qustions or if you want to help feel free to contact me.

Best regards
